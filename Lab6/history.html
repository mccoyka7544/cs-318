        <p>A traditonal shirley temple is made with gingerale, lime juice and grenadine topped with a maraschino cherry. Modern reciepes incorporate lemon-lime soda, such as sprite, which is my personal favorite.</p>
        <p>The drink is sometimes called a "Shirley Temple" named after the child actress who was said to have liked the drink. But in the world's biggest plot twist, Shirley Temple herself does like the drink.  When asked about the drink in a 1986 NPR interview, Temple said "I hate them. Too sweet!"</p>
